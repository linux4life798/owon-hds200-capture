# OWON HDS200 Series Oscilloscope Capture Tool

## Usage

Unclear still, but I want visualization with inspection of the oscilloscope data.

## Compatibility

I have only tested this with an OWON HDS272S, but I believe this is compatible
with all [HDS200 Series Oscilloscopes](https://www.owon.com.hk/products_owon_hds200_series_digital_oscilloscope) and probably all [HDS300 Series Oscilloscopes](https://www.owon.com.hk/products_owon_hds300_series_digital_oscilloscope).

It is also possible that this is compatible with the OWON PDS6062T Oscilloscope, since my HDS272S identifies itself with a USB vendor and product ID of the PDS6062T.
This could simply be due to OWON using the same vendor/product ID for all devices.
